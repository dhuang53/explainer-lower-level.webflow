          <h1 class="content-heading-h1">How common is it for viruses to move from animals to humans?</h1>
          <p class="content-paragraph">Humans do not exist within a bubble, but coexist with numerous other species, from the largest mammal to the tiniest flea. Interspersed among these large-scale interactions are even smaller, less appreciated run-ins with the pathogens that call each species home. These micro scale exchanges result in the spillover of bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms. Pathogen spillover from one species to another only occasionally results in measurable illness and rarely causes a full-blown pandemic. <br>The World Health Organization classifies any infection that jumps from animals to humans as a zoonotic disease (1). Various types of animal-borne pathogens cause zoonotic diseases. The bubonic plague that spread across Europe in the 1300s resulted from the transfer of <em>Yersinia pestis </em>bacteria from a flea bite. While the transfer of zoonotic bacteria continues to pose a threat, many modern day zoonotic diseases result from the transfer of viruses. Mosquito bites can readily transfer Dengue virus, Zika virus, Chikungunya virus, yellow fever, and more. However, even a common dog or cat can transfer rabies or other zoonotic viruses. Researchers estimate that the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) made its way to humans in the late 1800s when humans hunted chimpanzees for meat and came in contact with contaminated chimpanzee blood (2). Numerous flu strains derive from birds, and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, commonly known as the swine flu, was caused by the transfer of a novel influenza strain from pigs to humans (3).Lastly, an assortment of pathogens, from the virus that causes the common cold to the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, originate in bat hosts (4). <br>With so many examples of zoonosis throughout his-tory, it would seem that the transfer of animal pathogens to humans is a common occurrence. In reality, zoonotic diseases are extraordinarily rare. Experts estimate that mammals and birds house as many as 1.67million unknown viruses (5). In contrast, scientists estimate that only 219 animal-borne viruses have infected humans throughout history. This suggests that only 0.1% of animal viruses have caused known infections in humans (6). </p>

          <h1 class="content-heading-h1">Do animals carry more viruses than humans?</h1>
          <p class="content-paragraph">Despite the rare occurrence of zoonotic viral transfer, some species seem to be a treasure trove of new pathogens. Bats, in particular, have been the source of numerous zoonotic diseases including Ebola virus disease, MERS, SARS-CoV,SARS-CoV-2, and common cold coronaviruses. Researchers estimate that every bat species may host as many as 17 undiscovered pathogens with zoonotic potential. Rodents may host as many as ten undiscovered pathogens with the potential to move into humans per species (7). <br>A key variable in the ability of some animals to host numerous pathogens is its number of species members. The bat order is so large that approximately one in five mammalian species is a bat (8). The number of different species with overlapping genetic similarities allows more opportunities for viruses to jump from species to species, acquiring new mutations along the way. A wide breadth of species also means that bats may exist in a variety of habitats (7). Rivaling bats are birds, where numerous species live in many different locales. Similar to bats, birds such as ducks, geese, terns, and gulls are a reservoir for every known strain of the influenza virus (9). For this reason, some scientists argue that bats are no more unique in their ability to host a wide breadth of pathogens than other species-rich animals (10). However, in a study recently published in <em>Nature</em>, researchers analyzed 188 known zoonotic viruses among humans and mammals and found that even after accounting for factors that increase zoonotic viral load, bats indeed host a significantly higher proportion of zoonotic pathogens than other mammals (7). <br>With all of those viruses, how do bats avoid becoming sick?Bats possess unique immune systems that balance enhanced host defense responses and immune tolerance. They constitutively express type I interferons (IFN) and IFN-stimulated genes. Increased autophagy also helps bats rapidly clear pathogens. These enhanced host defense responses are counterbalanced with suppressed inflammasome pathways that contribute to extraordinary immune plasticity (11). </p>

          <h1 class="content-heading-h1">What makes a virus species-specific</h1>
          <p class="content-paragraph">Pathogens tend to stick within the host animal that they call home. Genetic similarity plays a key role in the transfer of pathogens from one species to the next. Numerous viruses can easily move between different bat species, which share common underlying genetic features. Similarly, viruses in chimpanzees are more likely to spread among other primate species, including humans (12). <br>The underlying molecular reason for this specificity is that viruses have evolved to preferentially bind to surface moleculeson host cells called viral receptors. Most viruses are decorated with surface proteins that preferentially target specific cells within the host species (12). For example, much like SARS-CoV-2, influenza is adorned with spike proteins that protrude from the surface of the virus. Influenza uses its own viral spike protein called hemagglutinin (H) to bind to cells in the upper respiratory tract. However, it specifically targets host cells with sialic acid residues — sugar chains attached to the ends of proteins and lipids (9). Different animals possess different sialic acids with different types of linkages that dictate the ability of viruses to infect cells in their respective host species (9). <br>The host, however, isn’t always an innocent bystander. Host proteases cut and modify parts of viral proteins, altering how the virus binds to host cells. SARS-CoV-2 gains access to host cells via the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which would not be possible without the help of two host proteases. The host proteins fur in and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) cut the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.These cuts alter the amino acid sequence and change the con-formation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, making it easier to bind human cells (13, 14). Recent studies suggest that other host cell mediators may also increase infectivity and aid inSARS-CoV-2 viral entry (15). </p>

          <h1 class="content-heading-h1">How do viruses move between unrelated species?</h1>
          <p class="content-paragraph">Selective pressures within a host species lay the groundwork for viruses to acquire new mutations and break free of the genetic confines that limit them to only one animal host. Researchers have long observed a molecular duel between coronaviruses and bats, which serve as the host for many different types of coronaviruses. The original SARS-CoV virus responsible for the2002 SARS epidemic also originated in bats. Similar to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV uses spike proteins to target and bind the ACE2 receptor in host cells.In a recent study, researchers analyzed the interplay between corona viruses and their bat hosts and found that bats carried many different versions of theACE2 receptor (16). <br>Evolutionary pressure from carrying multiple coronaviruses causes the ACE2receptor in bats to more readily acquire new mutations, resulting in different amino acid combinations that directly affect the binding of spike proteins. In turn, adaptations to the ACE2 receptor in bats place evolutionary pressure on coronaviruses to acquire new spike protein mutations that better facilitate their entry into host cells (16). While some mutations acquired in initial host species can cause zoonotic dis-eases, often viral mutations are enhanced by genetic mixing in intermediate host animals. For example, the H1N1 flu virus, commonly called the swine flu, originated in birds. Birds and pigs have the same type of sialic acids on the cells of their tracheae, which allowed the virus to transfer easily from bird hosts to pig hosts.A portion of pig cells also carry a type ofsialic acid found in human cells. Thus, pigs served as the ideal mixing vessel for the adaptation of a novel bird influenzastrain to infect human cells (17). Intermediate animal hosts allow viruses from two different species to interact. In some cases, these viruses may swap segments of genetic mate-rial through recombination or reassortment. Both cases produce a new viral strain with the potential to infect cells in a new host species (18). Scientists suspect that SARS-CoV-2 has a similar origin story. Recent studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and moved into an intermediate animal host, most likely the pangolin, where it acquired new mutations before transferring to humans (19). </p>

          <h1 class="content-heading-h1">What is the immune system&#x27;s role in preventing viral jumps?</h1>
          <p class="content-paragraph">Entering host cells is only half the battle. Once inside host cells, viruses must traverse a hostile environment where immune defenses lurk behind every corner, ready to eliminate pathogenic threats. The ability of zoonotic viruses to evade host immune responses determines their success in a new host species. Coronaviruses, includingSARS-CoV-2, have evolved several strategies for disabling the innate immune response of host cells. When a virus enters a cell, the host cell temporarily wraps it in an endosome. Viral genomic RNA is then released into the cytoplasm. Both endosomes and naked RNA act as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that signal to host cells that a pathogenic invasion is underway. Recognition pathways activate downstream signal-ing cascades that stimulate the host’s innate immune system (20). <br>Coronaviruses, however, have evolved to outsmart the immune system. Upon entry into host cells, coronaviruses immediately interfere with endosome and RNA sensing mechanisms. SARS-CoV does this by stimulating the degradation of RNA senor molecules. MERS-CoV suppresses RNA sensor molecules via repressive histone modifications(20). In a recent study, researchers discovered that SARS-CoV-2 hijacks a host enzyme and uses it to add methyl groups to SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA to shield it from being recognized byhost RNA sensors (21). Coronaviruses also take a more proactive approach to ensure their successful viral replication. Once they release their genetic material into the cytoplasm, built-in viral machinery immediately translates two large open reading frames that are processed into nonstructural proteins (NSPs). These NSPs form a double-membrane complex where the virus can replicate and form double-strandedRNA copies of itself without triggering the host immune response (22). <br>To further ensure their success, coronaviruses also release viral proteins that obstruct ribosomal messenger RNA(mRNA) entry, block nuclear export and splicing of newly made mRNA, and compromise the export of cellular proteins. Altogether, this hinders the production of newly synthesized immune-related mRNAs (20, 22). Cumulatively, these viral evasion mechanisms delay the immune system just enough to allow the virus to replicate, break free of its host cell, and infect other cells. When the innate immune system of the host finally catches up, it overcompensates by producing excessive amounts of hyper inflammatory neutrophils and macrophages (20).This delayed host immune response and overcompensation contribute to the destructive cytokine storm observed with COVID-19. </p>
